# Quick note for our backend data
- For the match rate report generation after the digital game, the machine learning analysis is faked for now.
- The pet information is hard-coded.
- The user information is set to default.
- The time in the game is not concurrent to the real world, and it is speeded up to generate more operations for product trail.

Two separate repos are implemented for deployment: frontend and backend.
